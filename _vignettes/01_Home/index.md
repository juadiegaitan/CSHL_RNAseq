## Overview

This tutorial provides a short introduction to the analysis of RNA-Seq experiments with 
R and Bioconductor. The Bioconductor project offers a large infrastructure of tools for 
the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is based on the R statistical programming
language, a widely used open source environment for data analysis and graphics. 


## Analysis steps

1. Read quality assessment, filtering and trimming
2. Map reads against reference genome
3. Perform read counting for required ranges (e.g. exonic gene ranges)
4. Normalization of read counts
5. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
6. Clustering of gene expression profiles
7. Gene set enrichment analysis
